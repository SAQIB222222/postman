It is commonly used to retrieve data from a server and to display it to the user, for example, when a user opens a web page, their browser sends a GET request to the server to retrieve the HTML file that makes up the page.\n",

    "The POST method is used to submit an entity to the specified resource, often causing a change in the server's state. It is not a safe method, as it may cause side-effects, such as updating data in a database or adding a new resource. It is commonly used to send data to a server, for example, when a user fills out a form on a website and clicks submit, their browser sends a POST request to the server with the data from the form.\n",
